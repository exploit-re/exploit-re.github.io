Hello,

Welcome to Exploit-RE. 

My name is Uday Mittal. I run a cybersecurity research lab by the name of [Yaksas CSC](https://yaksas.in). I created Exploit-RE as a supplimentary resource to my exploit development courses: 

- [Hands-on Exploit Development](https://courses.yaksas.in/p/hands-on-fuzzing-and-exploit-development)
- [Hands-on Exploit Development (Advanced)](https://courses.yaksas.in/p/hands-on-fuzzing-and-exploit-development-advanced)
- [Immunity Debugger for Exploit Devs - YCSC Lab Essentials](https://courses.yaksas.in/p/immunity-debugger-for-exploit-devs-ycsc-lab-essentials) - Free course

Here you will find resources related to exploit development and reverse engineering. I hope to keep updating this website or regular basis.

A lot of the work here is inspired by the research other people have done and made available in public domain. A big thanks to them. Wherever possible, I have provided their details in acknowledgemnts or as part of the resource itself.
